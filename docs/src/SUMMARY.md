Summary
=======

Same as the codebase, these docs have been forked from the [ord]
(https://github.com/ordinals/ord).

For clarity: Relics is not affiliated with the Ordinals "team" in any
way. We are also not against Runes â€” the excellent Runes codebase is one
of the reasons Relics exists. We simply want to experiment with L1 AMM
and see how it goes.
